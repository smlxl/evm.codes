          <H3>What is a smart contract?</H3>A smart contract is a set of

        <p className="pb-6">
          During a smart contract execution, memory can be accessed with
          opcodes. When an offset is first accessed (either read or write),
          memory may trigger an expansion, which costs gas.
        </p>
        <p className="pb-6">
          Memory expansion may be triggered when the byte offset (modulo 32)
          accessed is bigger than previous offsets. If a larger offset trigger
          of memory expansion occurs, the cost of accessing the higher offset is
          computed and removed from the total gas available at the current call
          context.
        </p>

        <p className="pb-4">
          <p className="pb-4">
            The total cost for a given memory size is computed as follows:
          </p>
          <Pre>
            <code>
              memory_size_word = (memory_byte_size + 31) / 32
              <br />
              memory_cost = (memory_size_word ** 2) / 512 + (3 *
              memory_size_word)
            </code>
          </Pre>
        </p>

        <p className="pb-4">
          <p className="pb-4">
            When a memory expansion is triggered, only the additional bytes of
            memory must be paid for. Therefore, the cost of memory expansion for
            the specific opcode is thus:
          </p>
          <Pre>
            <code>
              memory_expansion_cost = new_memory_cost - last_memory_cost

          The <code>memory_byte_size</code> can be obtained with opcode{' '}
          <RelativeLink to="#59" title="MSIZE" />. The cost of memory expansion
          triggered by <RelativeLink to="#59" title="MSIZE" /> grows
          quadratically, disincentivizing the overuse of memory by making higher
          offsets more costly. Any opcode that accesses memory may trigger an

          ). Use our <RelativeLink title="reference" /> to review which opcode
          is capable of accessing memory. Note that opcodes with a byte size
          parameter of 0 will not trigger memory expansion, regardless of their

          Access list is defined per external transaction, and not per call.
          Each transaction may be defined by some combination of its sender,
          calldata, or callee. Transactions can either be external or internal.
          External transactions are sent to the Ethereum network. Internal
          transactions are triggered by external transactions that have executed
          the xCALL instruction. As such, internal transactions are also known
          as calls. Access list can be thought of as two independent types of
          lists: those of touched addresses, and those of touched contract
          storage slots.
        </p>
        <p className="pb-6">
          When an address is accessed by a transaction, instruction, or used as

          <RelativeLink to="#31" title="BALANCE" />, on an address not present

        <p className="pb-6">
          Touch slot lists are a list of storage slot keys accessed by contract
          addresses. Slot lists are initialized to empty. When an opcode
          accesses a slot that is not present in the list, it adds it to it.
          Opcodes that can modify the touched slot list are{' '}

        <p className="pb-6">
          If an address or storage slot is present in the set, it is called
          'warm'; otherwise it is 'cold'. Storage slots that are touched for the
          first time in a transaction change from cold to warm for the duration
          of the transaction. Transactions can pre-specify contracts as warm
          using EIP-2930 access lists. The dynamic cost of some opcodes depends
          on whether an address or slot is warm or cold.

          At the start of a transaction's execution, the touched addresses set
          is initialized to include the following addresses, which are hence
          always 'warm':

              addresses as well as <b>tx.sender</b> and <b>tx.to</b> (or the
              address being created if it is a contract creation transaction).
            </li>
            <br></br>

        <p className="pb-8">
          Some opcodes can trigger gas refunds, which reduces the gas cost of a
          transaction. Gas refunds are applied at the end of a transaction. If a
          transaction has insufficient gas to reach the end of its run, its gas
          refund cannot be triggered, and the transaction fails. With the
          introduction of the <b>London</b> hardfork, two aspects of gas refunds
          changed. First, the limit to how much gas can be refunded is lowered
          from half of the total transaction cost to one fifth of the total
          transaction cost. Second, the{' '}
          <RelativeLink to="#FF" title="SELFDESTRUCT" /> opcode cannot trigger
          gas refunds, only <RelativeLink to="#55" title="SSTORE" />.
