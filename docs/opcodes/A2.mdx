## Notes

This instruction has no effect on the EVM state. See [here](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/anatomy/#events-and-logs).

## Stack input

0. `offset`: byte offset in the [memory](/about) in bytes.
1. `size`: byte size to copy.
2. `topic1`: 32-byte value.
3. `topic2`: 32-byte value.

## Error cases

The state changes done by the current context are [reverted](#FD) in those cases:
- Not enough gas.
- Not enough values on the stack.
- The current execution context is from a [STATICCALL](/#FA) (since Byzantium fork) or an [EXTSTATICCALL](/#FB) (since EOF fork).
