*Index 1 is top of the stack. See [PUSH](/#60).*

## Notes

Pop from the stack a word as an `offset` to locate and read a word from the memory at `offset` position and push into top of stack. Expand memory with uint256(0) to the `offset` position if necessary.

## Stack input

0. `offset`: offset in the [memory](/about) in bytes.

## Stack output

0. `value`: the 32 bytes in [memory](/about) starting at that offset. If it goes beyond its current size (see [MSIZE](/#59)), writes 0s.

## Examples

| Memory |
|-------:|
| `0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000FF` |

| * | Input | Output | * | * | Input | Output |
|--:|------:|-------:|--:|--:|------:|-------:|
| `1` | `0` | `0xFF` | * | `1` | `1` | `0xFF00` |

## Error cases

The state changes done by the current context are [reverted](#FD) in those cases:
- Not enough gas.
- Not enough values on the stack.
