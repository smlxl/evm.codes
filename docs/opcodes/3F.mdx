*Index 1 is top of the stack. See [PUSH](/#60).*

## Notes

Not allowed in EOFv1 code, code containing this instruction will fail validation.

## Stack input

0. `address`: 20-byte address of the account. If `address` points to an EOF contract, result is as if its code was `EF00`.

## Stack output

0. `hash`: hash of the chosen account's [code](/about), the empty hash (0xc5d24601...) if the account has no [code](/about), or 0 if the account does not exist or has been destroyed.

- Not enough gas.
- Not enough values on the stack.
