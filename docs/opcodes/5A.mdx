*Index 1 is top of the stack. See [PUSH](/#60).*

## Notes

Not allowed in EOFv1 code, code containing this instruction will fail validation.

## Stack output

0. `gas`: remaining gas (after this instruction).

## Example

[See in playground](/playground?unit=Wei&codeType=Mnemonic&code='GASyPUSH3%2021000zCosqof~transactionyGASLIMITzGaskhaqwjgivenko~context__zResulqis~amounqof%20gjused%20upko%20andbncluding~GASbnstruction'~khe%20z%20%2F%2F%20y%5Cnqt%20k%20tjas%20b%20i_ySUB%01_bjkqyz~_).

## Error cases

The state changes done by the current context are [reverted](#FD) in those cases:
- Not enough gas.
- Stack overflow.
