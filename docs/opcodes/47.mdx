## Notes

Semantically equivalent of calling [BALANCE](/#31) with [ADDRESS](/#30) as parameter, but with a reduced gas cost.

## Stack output

0. `balance`: balance of the current account in [wei](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wei.asp).

## Example

| Input | Output |
|------:|-------:|
| | `125985` |

## Error cases

The state changes done by the current context are [reverted](#FD) in those cases:
- Not enough gas.
- Stack overflow.
