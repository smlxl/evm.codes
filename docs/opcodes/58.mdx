## Notes

The program counter (PC) is a byte offset in the deployed [code](/about). It indicates which instruction will be executed next. When an [ADD](/#01) is executed, for example, the PC is incremented by 1, since the instruction is 1 byte. The [PUSH](/#60) instructions are bigger than one byte, and so will increment the counter accordingly.

## Stack output

0. `counter`: PC of this instruction in the current program.

## Example

| Input | Output |
|------:|-------:|
| | `856` |

## Error cases

The transaction is reverted in those cases:
- Not enough gas.
- Stack overflow.
