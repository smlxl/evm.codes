*Index 1 is top of the stack. See [PUSH](/#60).*

## Notes

The program counter (PC) is a byte offset in the deployed [code](/about). It indicates which instruction will be executed next. When an [ADD](/#01) is executed, for example, the PC is incremented by 1, since the instruction is 1 byte. The [PUSH](/#60) instructions are bigger than one byte, and so will increment the counter accordingly.

Not allowed in EOFv1 code, code containing this instruction will fail validation.

## Stack output

0. `counter`: PC of this instruction in the current program.

## Example

[See in playground](/playground?unit=Wei&codeType=Mnemonic&code='~0x~1xJUMPDESTzesq2x~3xPUSH1%201%20l4x~6%20%7Bpreviouminstructionmtakem2%20bytes%7D'~PCwwwlz%20%2F%2F%20Offx%5Cnw%20%20qt%20ms%20lzseq%01lmqwxz~_).

## Error cases

The state changes done by the current context are [reverted](#FD) in those cases:
- Not enough gas.
- Stack overflow.
