*Index 1 is top of the stack. See [PUSH](/#60).*

## Notes

The program counter (PC) is a byte offset in the deployed [code](/about). It indicates which instruction will be executed next. When an [ADD](/#01) is executed, for example, the PC is incremented by 1, since the instruction is 1 byte. The [PUSH](/#60) instructions are bigger than one byte, and so will increment the counter accordingly.

The **RJUMPV** instruction may alter the program counter with relative offset, thus breaking the linear path of the execution to another point in the deployed [code](/about). It is used to implement functionalities like switch statements. if `case > max_index` (out-of-bounds case), fall through and increment the counter by `(max_index + 1) * 2` without `relative_offset` takes into account.

An interesting feature is that `RJUMPV 0 relative_offset` is an inverted-[RJUMPI](/#E1), which can be used in many cases instead of `ISZERO RJUMPI relative_offset`.

It offers reduced gas cost (both at deploy and execution time) and better analysis properties.

## Stack input 

0. `case`: value that is popped from the stack, used to compare with max index, and define how program counter will altered.

## Immediate argument

0. `max_index`: the maximum index in the jump table - list of relative offset which one of them will be the point where execution will continue from.
1. `relative_offset+`: list of relative offsets in the deployed [code](/about).

## Example

*TBD: example in playground*

## Error cases

The state changes done by the current context are [reverted](#FD) in those cases:
- Not enough gas.
- Execution in a legacy (non-EOF) context.
