*Index 1 is top of the stack. See [PUSH](/#60).*

## Notes

The program counter (PC) is a byte offset in the deployed [code](/about). It indicates which instruction will be executed next. When an [ADD](/#01) is executed, for example, the PC is incremented by 1, since the instruction is 1 byte. The [PUSH](/#60) instructions are bigger than one byte, and so will increment the counter accordingly.

The **RJUMPI** instruction may alter the program counter with relative offset, thus breaking the linear path of the execution to another point in the deployed [code](/about). It is used to implement functionalities like loops and conditions.

## Stack input

0. `condition`: value that is popped from the stack, define how program counter will altered.

## Immediate argument

0. `relative_offset`: 2-byte relative offset in the deployed [code](/about) where execution will continue from.

## Example

*TBD: example in playground*

## Error cases

The state changes done by the current context are [reverted](#FD) in those cases:
- Not enough gas.
- Execution in a legacy (non-EOF) context.
