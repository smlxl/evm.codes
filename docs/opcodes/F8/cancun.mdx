## Gas

    static_gas = {gasPrices|extcallGas}
    dynamic_gas = memory_expansion_cost + code_execution_cost + address_access_cost + positive_value_cost + value_to_empty_account_cost

The memory expansion cost explanation can be found [here](/about).

The different costs are:
 - `code_execution_cost` is the cost of the called code execution.
  - If `address` is not warm, then `address_access_cost` is {gasPrices|coldaccountaccess} minus {gasPrices|warmstorageread}, otherwise it is {gasPrices|warmstorageread}. See section [access sets](/about).
 - If `value` is not 0, then `positive_value_cost` is {gasPrices|callValueTransfer}. In this case there is also a call stipend that is given to make sure that a basic fallback function can be called. {gasPrices|callStipend} is thus removed from the cost, and also added to the `gas` input.
 - If `value` is not 0 and the `address` given points to an empty account, then `value_to_empty_account_cost` is {gasPrices|callNewAccount}. An account is empty if its balance is 0, its nonce is 0 and it has no code.
